                        Symposium Monday October 24, 2016<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Organized by the <a href="http://letstudio.gu.se/">LETStudio</a>, University of Gothenburg. Held in conjunction with the NordiCHI workshop on Mobile health and wellbeing

                <p>
                  It is often argued, both among researchers and in popular media, that technology leads to

                  more stress and thus constitutes a mental health risk in society. At the same time, we see

                  how people increasingly turn to technology to handle stress and negative emotions in

                  various ways. A large industry is emerging around the development of services and

                  hardware intended to support mental health wellness, including quantified self, virtual reality

                  technologies, meditation and tracking apps, etc. The rapid development of mobile

                  technologies and mobile internet presents a range of challenges, but also important

                  opportunities for individuals suffering from mental health issues as well as healthcare

                  professionals working with treatment, and technology developers creating products. These

                  same opportunities can offer significant support to researchers interested in understanding

                  people’s behaviour in relation to mental health wellness. As the popularity of digitally

                  mediated therapy and training increases, significant questions emerge.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In this one-day symposium, we focus on the connection between mental health and

                information technologies, exploring connections between research and practice within this

                domain. The symposium is organized by the LETStudio at the University of Gothenburg. We

                invite researchers and practitioners to gather our efforts within this area, focusing on the

                opportunities that emerging technologies entail for mental health and wellbeing. The

                symposium consists of two invited speakers, who will tell us about their experience

                connected to this theme. A few student projects will be presented as well, as inspiration for

                our discussions. Finally, we will hold a panel discussion addressing the connection between

                research and practice, and the implementation and dissemination of technological tools for

                increased mental health. We will end by a short meditation session before

                <h1>Keynote 1: Embodying Mental Health: Virtual Reality Paradigms for

                Mental Health and Wellbeing</h1>

                <h2>Caroline J Falconer, Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham. </h2>
                <p>
                  The virtual reality (VR) field for mental health has been dominated over the last decade by

                  exposure based treatments for phobias and PTSD. However, new advances in VR offer

                  psychologists a unique opportunity to understand and address the notion of the “Self”.

                  Through the phenomena of presence and avatar embodiment, VR users have a sense of

                  being present in the virtual world and have self-identification with and agency over their

                  avatars. Exploiting and manipulating these phenomena can provide us with insight into the

                  construction of the Self and its multiple aspects, as well as providing a means of interacting

                  with the self to bring about healthy change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I will outline current trends within the field of VR and I will present findings from my own work

                  that go beyond exposure based paradigms to demonstrate the potential for VR to inculcate

                  positive, affiliative emotions conducive to mental health in depression. Furthermore, I will

                  discuss ongoing work that implements VR software alongside therapy within a healthcare

                  setting for young people with depression and anxiety and for personality disorders. I will

                  share insights into issues of implementation from these studies and discuss the future

                  direction of the field.
                </p>
